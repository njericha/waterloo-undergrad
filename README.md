### find_winner.py
This function demonstrates reading from a file and determine the score of the "winning team".

## MATLAB
MATLAB was used in AMATH 242: Computational Mathematics to teach a variaty of algorithms and techniques with applications.
### findroot.m
This function performs a basic Newton Method root finder.
### signalhighlow.m & train_bird.wav
This script showcases fourier techniques to filter out different frequencies from an audio file. The extracted audio is plotted in both time and fourier space.

## LaTeX
LaTeX was self taught but has been nessesary for any major projects throughout my undergrad.
### Richardson Justifying the Classical No-Slip Boundary Condition.pdf
This file is my final project for AMATH 361: Continuum Mechanics. It showcases multiple figures, paragraph formatting, and hyperlinks throughout the document.
